Automatic builds (snap)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When properly configured (TBD), launchpad does up 4 daily builds if code is
modified in bitmask-dev repo. We're building for amd64 and i386. They are
pushed to beta channel in the snap store.  If you need to force a build,
trigger it by editing the version string in the snapcraft.yaml file.

Releasing snaps
----------------

From the snap dashboard, you can see the revisions that are built.
By default, we have riseupvpn-builds configured to upload builds to beta and
edge channels. If you are going to be pushing to edge manually regularly,
please configure the automated builds to push just to beta for some time and
push your builds to edge channel.

To publish a snap, click on "release" from the dashboard, and assign a channel to them.

By convention, if you release to a channel, please release the revision to all
the lower channels too.  (For example, if you release a particular revision to
"candidate", release it also to "beta" and "edge"). 

Do note that the automated builds for different architectures do have different revision
numbers, so when releasing you have to repeat the steps for each platform that
we're building for.

From the command line:

  snapcraft login
  snapcraft status riseup-vpn

  # if we've built a release manually, we have to push it first. it gives us a
  # revision number that we use in the next step.

  snapcraft push riseup-vpn_0.10.6+git_amd64.snap
