Build
-----

Install dependencies:

```
  sudo make depends
```

Build the application:

```
  git clone 0xacab.org/leap/bitmask-vpn && cd bitmask-vpn
  make build
```

You need at least go 1.11. If you have something older and are using ubuntu, you can do:

```
  make install_go
```

For other situations, have a look at https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Ubuntu or https://golang.org/dl/


OSX
----------
Using homebrew:

```
  git clone 0xacab.org/leap/bitmask-vpn && cd bitmask-vpn
  make depends
  make build

```

Running tests
-------------

  sudo apt install qml-module-qttest
  make test
  make test_ui

TODO: move this to developer docs

The translations are done in transifex. To help us contribute your translations there and/or review the existing
ones:
https://www.transifex.com/otf/bitmask/RiseupVPN/

When a string has being modified you need to regenerate the locales:
```
  make generate_locales
```


To fetch the translations from transifex and rebuild the catalog.go (API\_TOKEN is the transifex API token):
```
  API_TOKEN='xxxxxxxxxxx' make locales
```
There is some bug on gotext and the catalog.go generated doesn't have a package, you will need to edit
cmd/bitmask-vpn/catalog.go and to have a `package main` at the beginning of the file.

If you want to add a new language create the folder `locales/$lang` before running `make locales`.
