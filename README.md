# arch

[There's a package in AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/riseup-vpn-git) that tracks main branch, so expect some instabilities (early birds catch the bugs they say, and we're thankful for that)

```
yaourt -Sy riseup-vpn-git
```

# gentoo

An ebuild is available in Gentoo's [main repository](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-vpn/riseup-vpn).

```
emerge riseup-vpn
```

# deb

We haven't updated deb.leap.se repo yet ðŸ˜ž (see #466), but if you *really* desire a debian
package you can build your own for the time being:

```
debuild -us -uc
sudo dpkg -i ../riseup-vpn*.deb
```

If you're using ubuntu, you can use [kali's ppa](https://launchpad.net/~kalikaneko/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).

## Build

Clone this repo, install dependencies and build the application. Dependencies
assume debian packages, or homebrew for osx. For Windows OS see corresponding section below. For other systems try
manually, or send us a patch.

```
  git clone git@0xacab.org:leap/bitmask-vpn.git && cd bitmask-vpn
  sudo make depends  # do not use sudo in osx 
  make build
```

You need at least go 1.11. 

If you have Ubuntu Bionic/18.04, the package in the repositories is too old. To resolve this, you can do `make install_go`. Do not do this if you have a later version.

For other situations, have a look at https://github.com/golang/go/wiki#working-with-go

## Test

You can run some tests too.

```
  sudo apt install qml-module-qttest
  make test
  make test_ui
```

## Windows
As for now app can be build on Win OS using `Cygwin` terminal.

#### Precondition
You need to have installed and added to your user PATH (mentioned version tested in Win10):
1) Go (>= go1.15.4)
2) QT (>= Qt5.12.9)
3) QtIFW (>= QtIFW-4.0.0)
4) Cygwin64 (>= 2.905 64 bit)
5) Using Cygwin `Package Select` window install `python3` and `make` packages. 

**Note:** for \#5 you don't need to add packages to PATH they will available in `cygwin` after installation.

#### Get Source
```
    git clone git@0xacab.org:leap/bitmask-vpn.git && cd bitmask-vpn
```

#### Build
Build script uses a symbolic link in one of the stages. Unfortunately Cygwin can't create native symlink from local non   
admin user due to windows security restriction. To avoid this issue we need to call next target from cygwin terminal as   
Administrator. This need to be done only once. 
```bash
    make relink_vendor
```

After `relink_vendor` use this to build the app:
```bash
    make build
```
After successful build application will be available at: `build/qt/release/riseup-vpn.exe`

#### Test

To run tests:

```bash
    make test
    make test_ui
```
