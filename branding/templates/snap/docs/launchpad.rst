launchpad
=========
In launchpad, you need to configure a git source for your project, and define a snap recipe for that source.

Be warned that launchpad does an automatic import every 6 hours.

If you need to do manual builds, you first need to trigger an import. Look for the "import now" button in your source page:

https://code.launchpad.net/~leapsnaps/riseupvpn/+git/riseup_vpn

Then you can trigger a manual build:

https://code.launchpad.net/~leapsnaps/+snap/riseup-vpn/+request-builds
